# Surfs-up Analysis.

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round in Oahu. We performed an exploratory climate analysis and generated summary statistics of temperature and precipitation from the previous year. 


### Tools Used
Jupyter notebook

Visual Studio Code

Flask

## Results

- The minimum temperature in June is 64F, while in December the minimum temperature is 56F

- The maximum temperature in the month of June is 85F, while in December the maximum temperature is 83F

- The standard deviation for both the month of June and December is very low, which indicates that the temperature statistics will mostly be similar in the upcoming year.

The statistics generated for June and December are illustrated below:

## Summary 
- The results obtained from the analysis notify that ice cream and surfing sales might be lower during December compared to June due to the minimum temperature being 59F in December, based on the obtained statistics.

- We can further obtain more information on the temperature by obtaining statistics on precipitation for the June and December months.
